Hello and welcome to my profile showcase! *Hope you like the decorations~* 

***Oh dear where are my manners***, My name is **Yudhistira Anggara**, yep you guessed it! Just like [The Pandava Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhishthira).

However you can just call my nickname **"Yuira"** or `ゆいら`, *a weaboo name, I know.*
My parent always told me that I have a knack for technology ~~and search on how to's around the internet~~ which further fueled my enthusiasm in the field of Informatics.
Feel free to look around my repositories, you might find something interesting, *perhaps even note-worthy*.
