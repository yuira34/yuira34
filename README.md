# Delighted to make your acquaintance. <img src="/src/wave.gif" width="30px">
You may have already known my nickname, but allow me to re-introduce myself *properly this time*. My name is [Yudhistira Anggara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuira-anggara/) and I'm an amateur **Data Scientist**.

My parent always told me that I have a knack for technology ~~and search on how to's around the internet~~ beside that I also acquired skills and knowledge along the journey to become a great data scientist. Feel free to look around my repositories, you might find something interesing, *perhaps even note-worthy*.
